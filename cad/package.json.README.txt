Error: ERROR in ./client/src/index.jsx 4:0-21
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'css-loader'

step 1: npm ls css-loader

if you get this:
fec_cad@1.0.0 /home/umonster/course/front-end-capstone/cad
└── (empty)

step 2: npm install --save-dev css-loader

if you still get Error

step 3:
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm install --save-dev css-loader
npm run start

I had to do it 3 times to get it to work... idk why
